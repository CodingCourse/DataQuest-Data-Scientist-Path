# # Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets
# 
# Mobile Apps usage are on the rise and people nowadays are more inclined to use a mobile platform than a web platform. This analysis is to understand more on the type of apps most people use, it's demographics and other important factors.
# 
# The goal is to find those app profiles which produce the most revenue based on the analysis we have done.

# As you can see from above, the no. of duplicate entries is really huge, thus before going further with the analysis, we should first clean the data, and then do our analysis on the same.
# 
# As the data is taken on different time, the main difference in the duplicate entries is the no. of rating, which we can see from the above data provided. Thus we have to remove all the duplicate ones, except the one which have the highest no. of rating, as it shows the latest data of that particular app.

# As you can see above, we first made a dictionary `reviews_max` with all the apps name as the key and the **highest** review of that particular app as the value.
# 
# Then with the help of two list, we divided the current list of google apps to `android_clean` and `already_added`. One to store our cleaned data set. And the other to help us to keep track of apps that we already added.
# 
# This is done with the help of dictionary we created before. We only appended the apps details which have the highest number of reviews among the duplicates using the dictionary.

# As we mentioned, we only build apps that are free to download and install, and our main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. Our data sets contain both free and non-free apps, and we'll need to isolate only the free apps for our analysis.
# 
# Thus we use the above method `take_free_apps` to remove all the paid apps from the list.
# 
# ## Validation Strategy
# 
# Our validation strategy for an app idea is comprised of three steps:
# 
# 1. Build a minimal Android version of the app, and add it to Google Play.
# 2. If the app has a good response from users, we then develop it further.
# 3. If the app is profitable after six months, we also build an iOS version of the app and add it to the App Store.
# 
# Because our end goal is to add the app on both the App Store and Google Play, we need to find app profiles that are successful on both markets. For instance, a profile that might work well for both markets might be a productivity app that makes use of gamification.

# ### Points we can infer from the above data about iOS:
# 
# 1. The most common genre in iOS is Games which constitutes more than half of the entire apps. And the next genre below is it Entertainment.
# 
# 2. If you check the top three apps, which constitutes around 71% of the entire apps is mostly based on fun (games, entertainment, photo & video) than utility.
# 
# 3. From the above two, we can clearly say that, most of the current developers are focused on developing apps in fun genre, rather than utility. And possibly, that captures the most amount of audience as well.
# 
# ### Points we can infer from the above data about Google Play Store:
# 
# 1. The most common apps are related to Family & Tools
# 
# 2. The number of apps of the utility is more than the fun apps.
# 
# 3. If we compare iOS with Google Play Store Apps, iOS have more apps in the fun section, while Google Play Store has more apps on the utility section.
# 
# 4. Based on the above details, creating a utility app on the Google Play Store seems much better.
